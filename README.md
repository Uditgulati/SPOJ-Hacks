# SPOJ-Hacks


A collection of small scripts that can make SPOJ experience much better (just my assumption, don't take it too seiously :P).

## Scripts

### Solve Check

+	**Usage:**

First add SPOJ usernames in the `users.txt` file. Use command `python3 main.py <problem_code>` and the script will scrape SPOJ profile pages and will output users who have solved it or just tried it.  

+	**Example:**
