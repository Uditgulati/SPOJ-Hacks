# SPOJ-Hacks


A collection of small scripts that can make SPOJ experience much better (just my assumption, don't take it too seriously :P).

## Scripts

### Solve Check

+	**Usage:**

First add SPOJ usernames in the `users.txt` file. Use command `python3 main.py <problem_code>` and the script will scrape SPOJ profile pages and will output users who have solved it or just tried it.  

+	**Example:**

</p>

### Most Tried

+	**Usage:**

Add SPOJ usernames in the `users.txt` file. Use command `python3 main.py <your_username> <num>`. Here, `<num>` is the maximum number of problems to be printed. The script only prints those problems which haven't yet been solved by you and in decreasing order of number of users who have atleast tried it.
